Use HTML only to create a Family Calendar (by loading the &lt;family-calender> Web Component)

For me learning to program has a preferred order. Alas many Web Components start by shopwing you JavaScript code, and tell you HOW to build Web Components.

* WHY - Motivation and purpose
* WHAT - Concepts, ideas and building blocks
* HOW - Syntax and implementation

# Web Components history

In the previous millenium Microsoft started with HTC... Mozilla took a stab in 2006 with XBL. It wasn't until 2011 Alex russell presented the first inclination of **standard** Web Components to the world.
Over the following years the Browser-vendors used Web Componnts technology to implement complex tag like <input> and <video>
Web Components technology enaled them to use a common API without having to standardize the inner workings of these tags; each vendor could write their own interpretation.
It wasn't until 2016 this Web Component API became available to us mortal developers in Chromium browsers. FireFox followed in 2017 and Safari in 2018
